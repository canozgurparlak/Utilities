The following data can be used for a performance comprasion between power coefficient and tip speed ratio from an aerodynamic point of view. For further detais please see the Theory Section in "http://canparlak.pythonanywhere.com/". They were written by Wilson, R. E.; Lissaman, P.B. and utilized a Simpson's Rule/three pass method of numerical integration. 

I'm just using them for the future works.
